- deal with agreements in dmgs (Evernote has one)
- deal with already mounted dmgs
- add option to add scripts
- look into and decompress zip files (do I need tar?)
- build packages from filelists
- use file lists from composer files
- identify app just by name or id
- identify shell scripts and build a payload free package
- identify mobileconfigs and build a package installer
- check if disk image was previously mounted before unmounting
- signature support
- other possible file formats: fonts, prefpanes, Safari extensions?
- use some preference setting to determine package name syntax
